Make it so you can run it by simply typing "todo" in the terminal,
similar to how writing "code" just opens up vsc

Maybe also make it so you can add an assignment without opening the app.
Ex: "todo" -> opens full application
"todo -c 'meet with boss' 'Meeting' 'finishing up report' '02-05-2024 10:00' '02-05-2024 11:00' 'todo'"
-> does NOT open the application but creates an assignment with the properties and adds it to the list,
then prints "assignment added!" so that you can see it next time you open the app

^ But you could make it simpler, for example:
if you don't include an event type it'll default to assignment
if you don't include a date itll default to the current day
if you dont include a KanbanStatus it'll default to todo for assignments and none for meetings
description is optional
etc etc. to make it faster to use. (hopefully this would just reuse the error checking from the
normal create assignment function)
